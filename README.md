# UCLA CS 32 - Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository presents my solutions for four projects and five homeworks assignments from UCLA CS 32 Winter 2022 with Professor Carey Nachenberg.
The class had really fun projects to work on, for e.g, project 3 asked us to build a version of Mario, and project 4 presented us with the opportunity to build our own dating app software.

Note: These are my own solutions and are therefore not perfect. Do not copy directly from these files as they will result in your own penalisation! Please adhere to the guidelines provided by the professor on academic honesty.
